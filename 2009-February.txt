Subject: [xrtl-user] Problem with item updates on client side - decision...
Message-ID: <137676665.20090214213408@mail.ru>

Hi, colleagues.

Answer to most peoples, which ask about item modify notifications
for update items...

The different OPC clients has different behavior when add the groups,
some clients subscribe group notification when the group not contain
the active items.

For testing XRTL server implementation I use the OPC Data Spy from
Iconics. This client has different behavior by different startup
process. If start it from stored file with client configuration -
XRTL work. But if I try open application and set connection to XRTL OPC
server - I have a problem with item updates.
If update by "Refresh" button - its Ok.


For decide this problem I make some modification in the
xrtl_opc_sdk_OPCDA20Group.pas unit in the
function TXRTLOPCDA20Group.EnqueueASyncRefresh(dwSource: OPCDATASOURCE;
  dwTransactionID: DWORD; out pdwCancelID: DWORD; DoOnDataChange: Boolean): HResult;

was:
if not(FActive and HasActiveItems) then ...
now:
if not(FActive) then ...

After that - all clients update items properly.

For Illya Kysil - please comment.

PS Sorry for my English.

Hi Vladimir,

Nice to know this code still helps to solve some problems :)

As to the proposed change - do you have access to any OPC compliance test suite?
It's hard to justify the cost of OPC Foundation membership for me just
to get the compliance testing tool.
Or wait, I have to pay just to get access to specification??? WTF?!?

I had an official suite when that code was produced. And all tests
were satisfied.
Nobody can say if the proposed modification breaks some specification or not
without access to any decent OPC compliance testing tool.

I'm not going to assert that XRTL OPC SDK have no compliance issues
taking into account following:
- there were no code updates since 2005;
- the original tool used to test the server sample may have bugs too;
- the most advanced processor at the time was Pentium (something) with
HyperThreading technology.

Beware of he who would deny you access to information,
for in his heart he dreams himself your master.

Yes, and I think this code still helps not only for me.

No need to define the goal to check XRTL with OPC compliance test
utility, possible to use good OPC clients (or Server for XRTL Client)
for testing.

ICONICS company is Charter Member of OPC foundation.
I use this company products for testing.
